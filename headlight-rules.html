      <!-- 1. What Are Low-Beam & High-Beam? -->
      <h2>1. What Are Low-Beam &amp; High-Beam?</h2>

      <h3>✔ Low-Beam</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Short-range light for normal city driving</li>
        <li>Does not blind oncoming traffic</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>✔ High-Beam</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Long-range bright light</li>
        <li>Used only in very dark or low-visibility areas</li>
        <li>Can blind oncoming drivers if misused</li>
      </ul>

      <!-- 2. When Low-Beam Must Be Used -->
      <h2>2. When Low-Beam Must Be Used</h2>
      <p>You must use low-beam in these situations:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Inside the city</li>
        <li>At traffic signals and junctions</li>
        <li>On crowded roads</li>
        <li>In residential areas</li>
        <li>When vehicles are coming from the opposite side</li>
        <li>When following another vehicle closely</li>
        <li>In rain, mild fog or drizzling</li>
        <li>At toll plazas, crossings and speed breakers</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Low-beam keeps you visible without blinding others. It should be the default
        choice for most driving conditions.
      </p>

      <!-- 3. When High-Beam Is Allowed -->
      <h2>3. When High-Beam Is Allowed</h2>
      <p>High-beam should ONLY be used when:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Highway is almost empty</li>
        <li>Road is completely dark</li>
        <li>No vehicle is coming from the opposite direction</li>
        <li>You need long visibility at night</li>
        <li>You are on rural roads with no streetlights</li>
        <li>There is an emergency in low visibility areas</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Think of high-beam as a tool for <strong>open, dark roads only</strong>.
      </p>

      <!-- 4. When High-Beam Is NOT Allowed -->
      <h2>4. When High-Beam Is NOT Allowed (Illegal / Unsafe Use)</h2>
      <p>High-beam should NOT be used in these situations:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Inside city limits</li>
        <li>Directly behind another vehicle (tailing)</li>
        <li>When another vehicle is coming toward you</li>
        <li>At traffic signals and busy junctions</li>
        <li>During rain (light spreads and blinds others)</li>
        <li>In fog (reflection reduces your visibility)</li>
        <li>In residential colonies</li>
        <li>Near hospitals and schools</li>
        <li>On very narrow streets</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        High-beam misuse is one of India’s biggest night-driving risks, especially
        for two-wheeler riders.
      </p>

      <!-- 5. Why High-Beam Is Dangerous -->
      <h2>5. Why High-Beam Is Dangerous</h2>
      <p>Misusing high-beam can cause:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Temporary blindness (glare) for the opposite driver</li>
        <li>Loss of depth perception</li>
        <li>Slower reaction time</li>
        <li>Side collisions</li>
        <li>High chance of bike accidents</li>
        <li>Difficulty judging distance of vehicles and objects</li>
        <li>Crashes while overtaking</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Even 1–2 seconds of glare can cause a major crash if speed is high.
      </p>

      <!-- 6. High-Beam Fines -->
      <h2>6. High-Beam Fines (Typical Range)</h2>
      <p>Fines vary by state, but commonly include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>₹500 – ₹1,500 for using high-beam in restricted areas</li>
        <li>₹1,000 – ₹2,000 for dangerous glare / rash use of headlights</li>
        <li>Fine may be added along with overspeeding or rash driving charges</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Police may also stop you for using aftermarket high-power headlights or
        illegal LED bars.
      </p>

      <!-- 7. Rules About Aftermarket Headlights -->

        <li>Very high watt white light (e.g., 200W+)</li>
        <li>Blue-tint HID kits</li>
        <li>Off-road auxiliary lights used on public roads</li>
        <li>High-shine projector LEDs not approved by manufacturer</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Police can:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Issue challan</li>
        <li>Ask you to remove or cover them</li>
        <li>Seize external LED bars in serious cases</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Only manufacturer-approved, road-legal headlights are recommended for
        everyday use.
      </p>

      <!-- 8. How to Drive Safely at Night -->
      <h2>8. How to Drive Safely at Night</h2>
      <p>Basic night driving safety tips:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use low-beam inside the city</li>
        <li>Use high-beam only on empty, dark roads</li>
        <li>Reduce speed at night, especially in unknown areas</li>
        <li>Keep windshield and mirrors clean</li>
        <li>Avoid looking directly into oncoming headlights</li>
        <li>
          Slow down when an oncoming vehicle is using high-beam (very common in India)
        </li>
        <li>
          You may blink high-beam quickly to alert others, but do not keep it on
          continuously
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Night driving should always be slower, safer and calmer than daytime driving.
      </p>
